# Package installation combines basic + profile:
# - Combinations: basic+dev (Linux) OR basic+mac (macOS)
# - Dev and mac are PARALLEL platforms, not hierarchical
# - Shared packages between dev/mac are intentional (both need dev tools)
# - Only basic packages should NOT be duplicated in dev/mac
packages:
  # Minimal essentials - installed on ALL machines (Linux + macOS)
